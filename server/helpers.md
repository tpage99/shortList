**MongoDB Up and Running**

Open Command line and enter the following: 

``"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"``

You should get [init and listen] waiting for connections on port 27017

Then, open another shell to connect to MongoDB: 

``"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongo.exe"``

This should be the mongo bash shell and you can enter mongo commands in this shell.
